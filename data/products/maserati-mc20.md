  [Maserati](https://www.caranddriver.com/maserati) has been teasing us with the new MC20 mid-engine sports car for some time now, and we've finally driven this sweet little cannoli and sampled its [novel 621-hp twin-turbo V-6](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a36453291/maserati-nettuno-v-6/).

  The MC20 is offered as a two-seater coupe with a minimalist cabin that's focused on the driver; a convertible is expected to join the lineup later and eventually an electric MC20 will reach production too.

  A collaboration with motorsport engineering company Dallara has resulted in a carbon-fiber structure with aluminum subframes for the suspension and powertrain. This construction minimizes weight, which sets the MC20 up for performance-related success.
