description: "Maserati has been teasing us with the new MC20 mid-engine sports car
  for some time now, and we've finally driven this sweet little cannoli and sampled
  its novel 621-hp twin-turbo V-6.\n\nThe MC20 is offered as a two-seater coupe with
  a minimalist cabin that's \nfocused on the driver; a convertible is expected to
  join the lineup later and eventually an electric MC20 will reach production too.\n\nA
  collaboration with motorsport engineering company Dallara has resulted in a carbon-fiber
  structure with aluminum subframes for the suspension and powertrain. This construction
  minimizes weight, which sets the MC20 up for performance-related success."
